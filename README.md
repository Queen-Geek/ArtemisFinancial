# ArtemisFinancial


The client is Artemis Financial, a company that provides individualized financial plans and works with various businesses, entrepreneurs, and government agencies. They wanted their software reviewed for security threats, particularly in securing communications and financial documents uploaded by customers from external threats such as hackers. They had 74 vulnerabilities and 13 vulnerable dependencies identified in their software.

After identifying the vulnerabilities, I recommended excluding the 13 dependencies that posed security risks. I also identified specific areas of security that were at risk, such as Cryptography, Input validation, APIs, client/server, and code error, and pointed out the specific dependencies and vulnerabilities associated with each. Secure coding is essential to protect a company's data and assets, enhance its reputation and trustworthiness, ensure compliance with industry regulations, and reduce the cost and effort of addressing security issues in the future. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by protecting against data breaches, financial losses, and legal penalties, and by fostering trust with customers and partners.

The manual review of the code was particularly challenging, as it required a thorough examination of the code files to identify potential vulnerabilities. However, it was also helpful as it allowed me to pinpoint specific areas where the code lacked proper security measures, such as the absence of parameters for user input validation and the lack of hashing for account numbers and balances.

I increased layers of security by recommending the implementation of secure communication protocols, secure data handling practices, and the review of code for potential vulnerabilities. I also suggested checking the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and updating or replacing any vulnerable dependencies, and I used the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin to identify vulnerable dependencies. In the future, I would consider the specific security needs of the client and the potential impact of vulnerabilities on their business operations when deciding on mitigation techniques.

I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure by implementing secure communication protocols, secure data handling practices, and reviewing the code for potential vulnerabilities. After refactoring the code, I used static analysis tools to automatically scan the code for vulnerabilities and check the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin. In the future, I would conduct functional testing to verify that the application works as expected and that the security measures do not negatively impact its functionality.

I used static analysis tools to automatically scan the code for vulnerabilities, the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin to identify vulnerable dependencies, and secure coding practices such as implementing secure communication protocols and secure data handling practices. These resources, tools, and practices would be helpful in future assignments or tasks as they provide a structured approach to identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.

I would show future employers the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, which provides a structured approach to identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities. I would also highlight the specific areas of security that were addressed during the refactoring process, such as secure communication protocols, secure data handling, and the review of code for potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, I would showcase the application of industry-standard best practices for secure coding and the value it adds to a company's overall wellbeing.
